# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python using the Tkinter library for the GUI. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns to place their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') on the grid. The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
